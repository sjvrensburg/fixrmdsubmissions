Description: Automatically repairs common technical issues in student R Markdown
    submissions so they can be knit reliably. Sequentially evaluates code chunks,
    adds 'eval = FALSE' to failing chunks, and intelligently fixes bare file paths
    to use the 'here' package. Designed for instructors who need to process hundreds
    of submissions with minimal manual intervention.
