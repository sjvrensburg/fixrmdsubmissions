Description: Automatically repairs common technical issues in student R Markdown
    submissions so they can be knit reliably. Sequentially evaluates code chunks,
    adds 'eval = FALSE' to failing chunks, and replaces file paths with absolute
    paths using intelligent filename-to-path mapping. Designed for instructors who
    need to process hundreds of submissions with minimal manual intervention.
