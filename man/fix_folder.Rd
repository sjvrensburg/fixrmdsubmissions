\usage{
fix_folder(
  path = "submissions",
  pattern = "\\\\.Rmd$",
  recursive = TRUE,
  fix_paths = TRUE,
  data_folder = "auto",
  add_student_info = TRUE,
  limit_output = TRUE,
  max_print_lines = 100,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string. Path to the folder containing R Markdown files.
Default is "submissions".}

\item{pattern}{Character string. Regular expression pattern to match files.
Default is "\\\\.Rmd$" (all .Rmd files).}

\item{recursive}{Logical. If TRUE (default), searches subdirectories recursively.}

\item{fix_paths}{Logical. If TRUE (default), replaces bare filenames with
absolute paths using filename-to-path mapping.}

\item{data_folder}{Character string. Which directories to search for data files
when using \code{fix_paths = TRUE}. Default is "auto" (both parent and current directory).}

\item{add_student_info}{Logical. If TRUE, adds the parent folder name (student
identifier) as a numbered heading at the beginning of each document. Useful
when students forget to include their name. Default is TRUE.}

\item{limit_output}{Logical. If TRUE (default), injects global setup code to
prevent massive data dumps. Passed to \code{fix_rmd()}.}

\item{max_print_lines}{Integer. This parameter is deprecated and ignored.
Kept for compatibility. Passed to \code{fix_rmd()}.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If TRUE, suppresses individual file progress messages.
Summary is still printed. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a character vector of output file paths.
}
\description{
Batch processes all R Markdown files in a directory (optionally recursive).
Designed for processing entire folders of student submissions efficiently.
Each file is processed with \code{fix_rmd()} and saved as \verb{*_FIXED.Rmd} in the
same location as the original.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fix all Rmd files in a submissions folder
fix_folder("submissions")

# Add student folder names as headings
fix_folder("submissions", add_student_info = TRUE)

# Fix non-recursively (only top-level folder)
fix_folder("homework", recursive = FALSE)

# Custom data folder
fix_folder("projects", data_folder = "raw_data")

# Disable path fixing
fix_folder("assignments", fix_paths = FALSE)

# Only show summary, not individual file progress
fix_folder("tests", quiet = TRUE)
}
