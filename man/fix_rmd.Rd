\usage{
fix_rmd(
  input_rmd,
  output_rmd = NULL,
  backup = TRUE,
  fix_paths = TRUE,
  data_folder = "auto",
  add_student_info = TRUE,
  limit_output = TRUE,
  max_print_lines = 100,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_rmd}{Character string. Path to the input R Markdown file.}

\item{output_rmd}{Character string or NULL. Path for the output file.
If NULL (default), appends "_FIXED" before the .Rmd extension.}

\item{backup}{Logical. If TRUE (default), creates a backup file with .bak extension.}

\item{fix_paths}{Logical. If TRUE (default), replaces bare filenames in import
functions with absolute paths using filename-to-path mapping.}

\item{data_folder}{Character string. Which directories to search for data files
when using \code{fix_paths = TRUE}. Default is "auto". Special values:
\itemize{
\item "auto": Automatically searches both parent directory and current directory (recommended)
\item ".": Only search current directory (where .Rmd file is located)
\item "..": Only search parent directory
\item "data" or other: Search specific subfolder relative to .Rmd file
}}

\item{add_student_info}{Logical. If TRUE, adds the parent folder name (student
identifier) as a numbered heading at the beginning of the document. Useful
when students forget to include their name. Default is TRUE.}

\item{limit_output}{Logical. If TRUE (default), injects global setup code to
prevent massive data dumps by setting appropriate pander options and output limits.
The setup code is added to existing setup chunks or creates a new setup chunk.}

\item{max_print_lines}{Integer. This parameter is deprecated and ignored.
Output limiting is now handled through global setup code injection.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If TRUE, suppresses progress messages. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the output file.
}
\description{
Processes a single R Markdown file to fix common student submission issues:
\itemize{
\item Sequentially evaluates all R code chunks in a shared environment
\item Adds \code{eval = FALSE} to chunks that fail to execute
\item Optionally replaces bare file paths with absolute paths using filename-to-path mapping
\item Optionally adds student folder name as heading
\item Creates backups before modification
\item Adds transparency comments explaining all modifications
}

Successfully executed chunks remain unchanged to preserve student work.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fix a single file
fix_rmd("student_submission.Rmd")

# Add student folder name as heading
fix_rmd("Smith_John_12345/homework.Rmd", add_student_info = TRUE)

# Specify custom output location
fix_rmd("homework.Rmd", output_rmd = "homework_corrected.Rmd")

# Disable path fixing if not needed
fix_rmd("project.Rmd", fix_paths = FALSE)

# Use custom data folder
fix_rmd("analysis.Rmd", data_folder = "raw_data")
