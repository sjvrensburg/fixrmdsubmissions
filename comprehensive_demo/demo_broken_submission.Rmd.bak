# Introduction

This R Markdown file demonstrates multiple common issues that break student submissions.

```{r setup}
# Missing required libraries that will cause errors
library(nonexistent_package)
library(undefined_library)

# This will work fine
x <- 1:10
```

# Data Loading with Broken Paths

```{r load-data}
# Absolute path that won't work on instructor's computer
bad_data <- read_csv("/home/student/Downloads/data.csv")

# Bare filename that won't work from different directory
another_bad_path <- read.csv("student_scores.csv")

# Should use here::here() but doesn't
yet_another_issue <- readRDS("model.rds")

# Missing data file
missing_file <- read_excel("nonexistent_file.xlsx")
```

# Data Analysis with Errors

```{r data-analysis}
# This will work
summary_data <- summary(iris)

# This will fail - undefined function
bad_analysis <- undefined_function(summary_data)

# This will cause warning but work
warning_example <- log(-1:10)

# This will work fine
working_analysis <- mean(1:100)
```

# Large Output That Should Be Limited

```{r massive-output}
# This will print thousands of rows and break documents
large_dataset <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5000,
  value = rnorm(5000),
  category = sample(letters[1:5], 5000, replace = TRUE),
  extra_data = rpois(5000, 3),
  another_column = runif(5000, 0, 100)
)

# This will create massive output that bloats PDFs
print(large_dataset)

# Another massive output
table_output <- table(large_dataset$category, large_dataset$category)
print(table_output)
```

# Visualization That Will Work

```{r visualization}
# This should work fine
plot(large_dataset$id[1:100], large_dataset$value[1:100],
     main = "Sample Visualization",
     xlab = "ID", ylab = "Value")
```

# Statistical Analysis with Cascading Errors

```{r stats-chunk}
# Depends on large_dataset from previous chunk
correlation_analysis <- cor(large_dataset$value, large_dataset$extra_data)

# This will fail and break all dependent chunks
bad_dependency <- use_function_that_doesnt_exist(correlation_analysis)

# This should work but depends on broken previous code
final_analysis <- mean(large_dataset$value)
```

# Export with Bad Paths

```{r export-data}
# More broken file paths
write.csv(large_dataset, "/absolute/path/output.csv")
saveRDS(final_analysis, "relative/path/results.rds")

# This would work if paths were fixed
# correct_path <- here::here("data", "results.csv")
```
