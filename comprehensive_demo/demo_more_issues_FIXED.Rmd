# Analysis of Student Performance Data

```{r, eval = FALSE setup, include=FALSE}
# [fixrmdsubmissions] Chunk execution disabled due to error: there is no package called ‘special_analysis_package’
# Missing libraries that will cause errors
library(special_analysis_package)
library(custom_visualization_tool)

# This part will work
set.seed(42)

# Global options to prevent massive data dumps
# Added automatically by fixrmdsubmissions package
library(pander)

# Limit console output to prevent massive data dumps
options(max.print = 1000)

# Configure pander for reasonable table output
panderOptions('table.split.table', 80)
panderOptions('table.emphasize.rownames', FALSE)
panderOptions('table.split.cells', 30)
panderOptions('keep.line.breaks', TRUE)

# Set reasonable line width
options(width = 80)

```

## Loading Data with Path Issues

```{r, eval = FALSE load-dataset}
# [fixrmdsubmissions] Chunk execution disabled due to error: cannot open the connection
# Various broken path patterns
# [fixrmdsubmissions] Path fixed to use here::here() for portability
student_data <- read_csv(here::here(".", "grades.csv"))  # Bare filename
class_data <- read.csv("../data/classes.csv")  # Parent directory 
# [fixrmdsubmissions] Path fixed to use here::here() for portability
import_file <- read_delim(here::here("data", "students.txt"), delim = "|")  # Relative path

# URL that might work but should be here
web_data <- read.csv("http://example.com/api/data.json")

# This would work with here package
# good_path <- here::here("data", "grades.csv")
```

## Data Exploration with Massive Output

```{r explore-data}
# Create huge dataset
big_student_data <- data.frame(
  student_id = rep(1:10000, each = 5),
  grade = rnorm(50000, 75, 15),
  subject = rep(c("Math", "Science", "History", "English", "Art"), 10000),
  semester = sample(1:8, 50000, replace = TRUE),
  attendance_score = runif(50000, 0, 100),
  assignment_score = runif(50000, 0, 100),
  exam_score = runif(50000, 0, 100),
  project_score = runif(50000, 0, 100),
  participation_score = runif(50000, 0, 100),
  extra_credit = rpois(50000, 2),
  comments = sample(c("Excellent", "Good", "Needs Improvement", "Outstanding"), 50000, replace = TRUE)
)

# This will cause massive data dump that breaks PDF rendering
print(big_student_data)

# More massive output from statistical summaries
detailed_summary <- summary(big_student_data)
print(detailed_summary)

# Huge frequency table that will bloat document
subject_table <- table(big_student_data$subject, big_student_data$semester)
print(subject_table)

# Complex analysis output
correlation_matrix <- cor(big_student_data[, c("grade", "attendance_score", "assignment_score", "exam_score", "project_score", "participation_score")])
print(correlation_matrix)
```

## Statistical Analysis with Errors

```{r, eval = FALSE statistical-analysis}
# [fixrmdsubmissions] Chunk execution disabled due to error: grouping factor must have exactly 2 levels
# This chunk will work fine
successful_analysis <- t.test(big_student_data$grade ~ big_student_data$subject)

# This will fail due to typo
failed_analysis <- ttes(big_student_data$attendance_score ~ big_student_data$participation_score)

# This will fail due to missing function
more_failure <- some_cool_statistical_function(big_student_data$exam_score)

# This depends on previous failed code
dependent_failure <- summary(failed_analysis)
```

## Visualization Section

```{r, eval = FALSE visualization}
# [fixrmdsubmissions] Chunk execution disabled due to error: could not find function "ggplot"
# Working visualization
plot(big_student_data$grade[1:1000], 
     main = "Student Grades Distribution",
     xlab = "Student Index", 
     ylab = "Grade",
     col = "blue")

# Failing visualization
failing_plot <- ggplot(big_student_data, aes(x = factor(subject), y = grade)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "red") +  # Will fail - ggplot not loaded
  theme_minimal()
```

## Final Analysis with Multiple Issues

```{r, eval = FALSE final-analysis}
# [fixrmdsubmissions] Chunk execution disabled due to error: could not find function "analysis_of_failing_chunks"
# This will work if previous chunks succeeded
final_grades <- aggregate(grade ~ subject, data = big_student_data, FUN = mean)

# This will fail due to undefined variable
final_error <- analysis_of_failing_chunks(bad_variable)

# This will also fail
another_error <- final_missing_function(final_grades)

# Working final step
print(final_grades)
```

## Export with Problematic Paths

```{r, eval = FALSE export-results}
# [fixrmdsubmissions] Chunk execution disabled due to error: cannot open the connection
# Multiple path issues
write.csv(final_grades, "final_results.csv")  # Bare filename
saveRDS(big_student_data, "large_dataset.rds")  # Bare filename
write.table(subject_table, "subject_summary.txt", sep = "\t")  # Bare filename

# Absolute path that won't work elsewhere
write.csv(correlation_matrix, "/home/student/Desktop/final_correlation.csv")
```
